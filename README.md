# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Download dataset from url
2. Merges 2 datasets: 1. the training  and 2.the test. Creates one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Creates a tidy.txt.
